This is my attempt at coding the bankist app from Jonas' javascript course on udemy. 

What makes this different to others, is that I did this without watching and following the tutorial, so there will be slight differences in both appearance and code.

I like to create projects using my own thought processes first, then reviewing the tutorials after.
